## Untracked by day-wise
- Introduction to recursion
- Linear Search
- Binary Search
- Arrays:
  - Reverse an array
  - Pairs in an array
  - Display the subarray of an array
- Recursion
  - Introduction to recursion
  - Find the sum of numbers from 1 till n
  - Factorial of n
  - Find the product of m^n^
- Strings
  - Check if a word is a Palindrome or not

---
## Things to learn
- How to tackle Questions
- How to break question to their basic parts when it comes to recursion
- Template "\<T>"
- Tower of Hanoi
- Sorting Algorithms
- Manipulation to arrays are global actions
- Its *Integer.MAX_VALUE* not *Integer.MAX*
- In a recursion:
  - Create and Utilize a class (Example: named as "Info")
    - if you need to return multiple values of different data-types
    - if the inner states need to communicate with the outter non-adjacent states
- While Tackling a question:
  - Present the most simple and inefficient, but not bruteforce, solution
- Java Library and their DataTypes:
  - Queues using LinkedList:
  - List and Arrays:
    - List<List<Integer>> answer = new ArrayList<>()
    - Whats the difference between `List<>` and `ArrayList<>`?
- Topics to learn:
  - Red Black Trees
  - AVL Trees
- Initialize variables in for-loop but with different data-types
- On on/off or 0/1 problems, think of even and odd approaches
- Interfaces
- Abstract classes
- Parse methods
- ### Priority Queue:
  - Learn how to quickly create priority queues of different objects
- ### Heaps:
  - By default, Java uses Min Heap
  - Visualization: Binary Tree
  - Implementation: Arrays
  - Filling of Heap follows a Complete Binary Tree
- ### Graphs:
  - Unidirectional and Bidirectional Graphs
  - Weighted and Unweighted Graphs
  - #### Storing graphs:
    - We store the graph's nodes and their immediate neighbours to which they are connected to
    - Data structures:
      - Using an Array of ArrayList
      - Using an ArrayList of ArrayList
      - Using Hashmaps
  - #### Adjacency Matrix
    - Table size: count(Vertices)^2^
    - As the name suggest, it denotes the the distance from one node to its **adjacent** neighbours
  - #### Edge List
    - It stores the unique sets of edges present in the graph
    - Data Structure:
      - An array of ArrayList
    - For weighted graphs, it also stores the weight of the edge between the nodes at the last position of their correspoding array in the edge list
  - #### Implicit Graph
  - #### Applications of Graphs:
    - Maps:
      - Finding the shortest path
    - Social Networks:
      - Finding friends within a social network
    - Deliveery Network:
      - Shortest cyclic route
  - #### Graph Traversal
    - On the decision to choose which of the child nodes to traverse first, do we utilize their weights as a factor?
    - ##### Methods to graph traversal:
      - ###### Breadth-First-Search (BFS):
        - It is similar to level traversal in a Tree
        - To keep track of nodes that had previously been traversed:
          - Implement a queue of the ID of the current node and its neighbouring nodes
          - Implement an array of boolean to indicate the nodes visited
      - ###### Depth-First-Search (DFS):
        <!-- - It traverses to the  -->

  
- ### Dynamic Programming:
  - It stores the pre-computed data into a data structure to reduce redundant computation
  - Dynamic Programming is optimized Recursion
  - Types:
    - Top-to-Bottom approach
      - This approach utilizes memoization
    - Bottom-to-Top approach
      - This approach utilizes tabulation
  - Techniques:
    - #### Memoization
    - #### Tabulation
  - Why does the fibonacci solution with **O(n)** time complexity require an extra memory space with `fibo(n+1)`?

- ### Threads
  - Thread.getState():
    - New
    - Runnable
    - Terminated
